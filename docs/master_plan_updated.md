- **Community Forum:** Set up a free forum using a platform like Discord or Discourse.
- **Public Roadmap:** Create a public roadmap to show users what we're working on.

### 3. Iterate & Enhance

**Goal:** Use user feedback to improve the product.

**Tasks:**

## Decision Point

We are at a critical juncture. The system is built, polished, and ready for users. Our next step is to decide the order of operations for the remaining Phase 2 tasks.

**Option A: Deploy First**
1.  Deploy to production immediately.
2.  Then, build feedback and community tools.

**Option B: Build Feedback Tools First**
1.  Implement the feedback mechanism and community forum.
2.  Then, deploy the complete system with these tools already in place.

Both are viable. Option A gets us to market faster, while Option B ensures we have feedback channels from day one.

What is your preference?
