## What's Next: Phase 2 - Public Launch & Enhancement

We are now ready to begin **Phase 2**. This phase is about taking our production-ready MVP and bringing it to the world.

**Key Objectives for Phase 2:**

1.  **Deploy to Production:** Make Project Alfred publicly accessible.
2.  **User Onboarding:** Implement a simple signup/login flow.
3.  **Gather User Feedback:** Create mechanisms for users to provide feedback.
4.  **Iterate & Enhance:** Use feedback to add new features and refine existing ones.
5.  **Community Building:** Start building a community of early adopters.

This is where we transition from building to growing. The system is ready.
